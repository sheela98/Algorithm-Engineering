\section{The Algorithm}

\subsection{Internal Representation of Mock Labels}
\label{sub:sec:internal}

In Figure~\ref{fig:integer:sets} we convert the mock labels to sorted integer sets.



\begin{figure}[htbp]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{./graphics/integer_sets.pdf}
  \caption{Conversion of mock camera labels to sorted integer sets. 
We map each unique token (key) in camera labels to a unique value. 
Based on these key-value-mappings, we convert camera labels to sorted integer sets. 
A camera can have different names in different countries. Therefore, repeating IDs reference the same cameras (see, for example, ID=3).} 
  \label{fig:integer:sets}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Efficient Preprocessing of Input Data}
\label{sub:sec:preprocessing}

The following findings are important to speed up preprocessing of the input data:

\begin{itemize}
\item Reading many small files concurrently, with multiple threads (compared to a single thread), takes advantage of the internal parallelism of SSDs and thus leads to higher throughput \cite{Zhuang2016}.

\item C-string manipulation functions are often significantly faster than their C++ pendants. For example, locating substrings with \texttt{strstr} is around five times faster than using the C++ \texttt{std::string} function \texttt{find}.

\item Hardcoding regular expressions with \emph{while, for, switch} or \emph{if-else} statements results in faster execution times than using standard RegEx libraries, where regular expressions are compiled at runtime into state machines.

\item Changing strings in place, instead of treating them as immutable objects, eliminates allocation and copying overhead.

\end{itemize}


\section{Experiments}

Table~\ref{tab:results} shows the running times of the resolution step of the five best placed teams.


\begin{table}[htbp]
  \caption{Comparison of the F-measure and the running times of the resolution step of the five best placed teams. The input data for the resolution step consisted of 29{,}787 in JSON formatted e-commerce websites. Measurements were taken on a
laptop running Ubuntu 19.04 with 16 GB of RAM and two Intel Core i5-4310U CPUs. The underlying SSD was a 500\,GB 860 EVO mSATA. We cleared the page cache, dentries, and inodes before each run to avoid reading the input data from RAM instead of the SSD.}
